# CheckThreatsAI - Final Degree Project

Welcome to the repository of **CheckThreatsAI**, a complete platform developed as part of a Final Degree Project. This repository contains all the components necessary for understanding, reproducing, and expanding the project.

## Contents

- üåê **Web Platform**:  
  The interactive web application that allows users to upload and analyze executable files (.exe) in a simple and intuitive way.

- üî• **Flask API**:  
  A microservice built with Flask in Python that processes uploaded files, extracts DLL activation patterns, and applies a trained neural network model to classify the file.

- üìà **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
  Full analysis of the selected dataset used to train the model, including data cleaning, feature selection, and balancing strategies.

- üß† **LSTM Neural Network**:  
  The final deep learning model (Long Short-Term Memory) trained to classify Windows executable files into several categories of malware or benign files.

- üñºÔ∏è **Images for Documentation**:  
  A collection of diagrams, charts, and screenshots used to illustrate the technical report and support the documentation.

## About the Project

The goal of **CheckThreatsAI** is to develop a reliable system capable of detecting potential malware in executable files through static analysis, using deep learning techniques to recognize patterns in the presence of DLLs.

This repository provides all the necessary resources to understand the design, development, and validation of the platform.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Bootstrap 5), JavaScript (ES6)
- Backend: Node.js (Express), MySQL
- Machine Learning API: Python (Flask, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, pandas)
- Dataset: Custom processed dataset based on Windows executable DLL activity
